Writing in air has been one of the most fascinating and challenging research areas in
field of image processing and pattern recognition in the recent years. It contributes
immensely to the advancement of an automation process and can improve the interface
between man and machine in numerous applications.Several research works have been
focusing on new techniques and methods that would reduce the processing time while
providing higher recognition accuracy.


Object tracking is considered as an important task within the field of Computer
Vision. The invention of faster computers, availability of inexpensive and good quality
video cameras and demands of automated video analysis has given popularity to object
tracking techniques. Generally, video analysis procedure has three major
steps: firstly, detecting of the object, secondly tracking its movement from frame to frame
and lastly analysing the behaviour of that object. For object tracking, four different issues
are taken into account; selection of suitable object representation, feature selection for
tracking, object detection and object tracking. In real world, Object tracking algorithms
are the primarily part of different applications such as: automatic surveillance, video indexing
and vehicle navigation etc.


The project takes advantage of this gap and focuses on developing a motion-to-text
converter that can potentially serve as software for intelligent wearable devices for writing
from the air. This project is a reporter of occasional gestures. It will use computer vision
to trace the path of the finger. The generated text can also be used for various purposes, such
as sending messages, emails, etc. It will be a powerful means of communication for the
deaf. It is an effective communication method that reduces mobile and laptop usage by
eliminating the need to write.
